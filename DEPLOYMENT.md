  - **History page**: Refresh user data and diagnostic sessions
  - **Other pages**: Reload the page content

### 2. AI-Generated Repair Tips
- New Supabase Edge Function: `generate-repair-tips`

- Tips include: title, description, category, difficulty, read time, and image alt text
- Fallback tips provided if AI generation fails

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy the New Supabase Function
```bash
# Navigate to the function directory
cd supabase/functions/generate-repair-tips

# Deploy the function

## Function Details

### generate-repair-tips Function
- **Purpose**: Generates AI-powered repair tips and tricks
- **Input**: None (generates tips automatically)
- **Output**: Array of 6 tip objects with structured data
- **Fallback**: Provides predefined tips if AI generation fails

### Tips Structure
Each tip includes:
- `title`: Catchy, specific title (max 60 characters)
- `description`: Brief, practical description (max 120 characters)
- `category`: Device type (Smartphone, Laptop, Audio, Gaming, Safety, Tools)
- `difficulty`: Skill level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- `readTime`: Estimated reading time (e.g., "3 min read")
- `imageAlt`: Descriptive alt text for accessibility

## Usage

### For Users
1. **Refresh Tips**: Click the "Refresh Tips" button on the home page to get new AI-generated tips
2. **Page Refresh**: Use the refresh button in the header of any page to reload content
3. **Community**: Refresh button reloads community posts
4. **History**: Refresh button updates user data and diagnostic sessions

### For Developers
- The refresh functionality is implemented through the `MobileHeader` component
- Each page can define its own refresh behavior by passing an `onRefresh` prop
- AI tips generation is handled by the `tipsGenerator.ts` utility

## Error Handling
- If AI generation fails, fallback tips are displayed
- Loading states are shown during tip generation
- Toast notifications confirm successful refreshes
- Console errors are logged for debugging

## Performance Considerations
- Tips are generated on-demand when refresh is clicked
- Loading skeletons provide smooth user experience
- Fallback tips ensure functionality even without AI
- Refresh operations are debounced to prevent spam clicking
